breakpoint [subcommand | [source-file:]line]

Sets a breakpoint, or operates on existing breakpoints.

With no arguments, attempts to set a breakpoint at the current location as determined
by the selected stack frame. With no source file, attempts to set a breakpoint at
the given line number in the source file at the current location.

Upon setting a breakpoint, the debugger may respond that the breakpoint was set
but not bound. There are several reasons this can happen:

* The line number specified has no executable code associated with it.
* The source file specified does not exist.
* The breakpoint is in a proper location in a good source file, but information
  about the source file has not yet been loaded. Not all languages know what source
  files will be loaded in the course of execution; for example, in node a source
  file will not be become available until some other module has called 'require'
  on it.

If the breakpoint is incorrectly specified, it will never be hit. However, in the
latter case, the breakpoint will become active when the runtime loads the specified
file.

The breakpoint command has several subcommands:

* 'delete' will delete an existing breakpoint
* 'disable' will temporarily disable an existing breakpoint
* 'enable' will re-enable an existing breakpoint
* 'help' will give detailed information about the subcommands
* 'list' will list all existing breakpoints
